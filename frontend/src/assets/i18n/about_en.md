[The Transnational Red Sea](https://trsc.org), established in 2019 at
[the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne](https://www.epfl.ch/)
with support from the Swiss Foreign Ministry, is an independent non-profit
organisation dedicated to coral reef conservation in the Red Sea. By
drawing on Switzerland's neutrality and scientific expertise, the Center
promotes scientific collaboration among Red Sea countries to better
understand how the region's corals have developed resilience to climate
change. It also develops innovative, cost-effective technologies to
enhance coral reef monitoring with higher resolution, standardisation, and
scalability. The Center advocates for environmental protection policies by
sharing these solutions with Red Sea nations and beyond, supporting
science-based efforts to conserve coral reefs globally.
