# Environmental DNA (eDNA) Research

Our eDNA research program uses cutting-edge molecular techniques to detect and monitor marine biodiversity in the Red Sea through DNA fragments released by organisms into the environment. This non-invasive approach allows us to survey biodiversity at unprecedented scales.

## Project Goals
- Develop a comprehensive eDNA barcode library for Red Sea species
- Monitor biodiversity changes across spatial and temporal gradients
- Detect rare, elusive, or invasive species
- Establish baseline biodiversity data for conservation planning

## Methodology
We collect water samples from various depths and locations throughout the Red Sea. These samples undergo filtration to capture eDNA, followed by extraction, amplification using metabarcoding approaches, and high-throughput sequencing. Sophisticated bioinformatics pipelines analyze the resulting data to identify species and community patterns.

## Applications
This research supports marine management by providing rapid biodiversity assessments, identifying critical habitats, and monitoring ecosystem responses to environmental changes and human impacts. Our eDNA research also contributes to discovering previously unrecorded species in the Red Sea region.
