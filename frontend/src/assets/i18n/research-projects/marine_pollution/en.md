# Marine Pollution Research

Our Marine Pollution Research program investigates the sources, distribution, and ecological impacts of various pollutants in the Red Sea ecosystem. From plastic debris to chemical contaminants, we study how pollution affects marine life and develop strategies for mitigation and remediation.

## Research Areas
- Microplastics distribution and ecological impacts
- Heavy metal contamination in sediments and marine organisms
- Oil pollution monitoring and assessment
- Urban runoff and wastewater impacts on coastal ecosystems
- Ecotoxicological effects on key marine species

## Methodology
Our research employs a combination of field sampling, laboratory analyses, and experimental approaches. We conduct regular surveys along the Red Sea coastline to collect water, sediment, and biological samples. Advanced analytical techniques including gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, ICP-MS, and spectroscopy are used to identify and quantify pollutants. Biomarker analyses help us understand the biological impacts of these contaminants.

## Applications
The findings from our research inform policy recommendations for sustainable coastal development, waste management practices, and marine conservation initiatives. We work closely with local authorities, industries, and communities to develop practical solutions for reducing pollution inputs and mitigating environmental impacts. Our monitoring programs also contribute to early warning systems for environmental degradation.
