# Seascape Genomics

Our Seascape Genomics project investigates the relationship between environmental conditions in the Red Sea and the genetic adaptations of marine organisms. By linking genomic data with oceanographic parameters, we aim to understand how marine life has adapted to the unique conditions of the Red Sea ecosystem.

## Research Focus
We analyze the genomes of various Red Sea species, with particular emphasis on:
- Coral species and their symbiotic relationships
- Fish populations across temperature gradients
- Invertebrate adaptations to high salinity
- Genetic connectivity between populations

## Methodology
Our research combines next-generation sequencing technologies with environmental data collection. We employ population genomics approaches, genome-wide association studies, and environmental association analysis to identify adaptive genetic variants and their relationships to specific environmental conditions.

## Significance
This research provides insights into how marine organisms may respond to climate change and identifies genetic resources that could be valuable for conservation efforts and biotechnological applications. The Red Sea's naturally high temperatures and salinity make it an ideal natural laboratory for studying adaptation to extreme conditions.
