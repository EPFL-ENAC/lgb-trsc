          Our Socio-Economic Research program investigates the complex
          relationships between coastal communities, marine resource use,
          economic development, and conservation in the Red Sea region. We aim
          to understand how human activities interact with marine ecosystems and
          develop sustainable management approaches that benefit both people and
          nature.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-h5 q-mt-lg q-mb-md">Research Focus</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Valuation of marine ecosystem services</li>
          <li>
            Traditional ecological knowledge and resource management practices
          </li>
          <li>Economic impacts of marine conservation initiatives</li>
          <li>Sustainable tourism development and impacts</li>

        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-h5 q-mt-lg q-mb-md">Methodology</h2>
        <p>
          Our research employs a mix of quantitative and qualitative methods,
          including household surveys, semi-structured interviews, focus group
          discussions, economic modeling, and market analyses. We work closely
          with local communities, government agencies, and private sector
          stakeholders to collect comprehensive data on resource use patterns,
          economic activities, and social dynamics.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-h5 q-mt-lg q-mb-md">Applications</h2>
        <p>
          The findings from our socio-economic research inform the development
          of integrated coastal management plans, marine protected area design,
          sustainable tourism initiatives, and alternative livelihood programs.
          By understanding the human dimensions of marine conservation, we help
          create more effective and equitable approaches to protecting the Red
          Sea's valuable ecosystems while supporting local communities.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-h5 q-mt-lg q-mb-md">Current Projects</h2>
        <p>
          Current projects include assessing the economic value of coral reef
          tourism, analyzing the impacts of marine protected areas on
          small-scale fishing communities, exploring traditional fishing
          knowledge and practices, and evaluating the potential for sustainable
          aquaculture development in the region.
