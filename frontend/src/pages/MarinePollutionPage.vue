          Our Marine Pollution Research program investigates the sources,
          distribution, and ecological impacts of various pollutants in the Red
          Sea ecosystem. From plastic debris to chemical contaminants, we study
          how pollution affects marine life and develop strategies for
          mitigation and remediation.

        <h2 class="text-h5 q-mt-lg q-mb-md">Methodology</h2>
        <p>
          Our research employs a combination of field sampling, laboratory
          analyses, and experimental approaches. We conduct regular surveys
          along the Red Sea coastline to collect water, sediment, and biological
          samples. Advanced analytical techniques including gas
          chromatography-mass spectrometry, ICP-MS, and spectroscopy are used to
          identify and quantify pollutants. Biomarker analyses help us
          understand the biological impacts of these contaminants.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-h5 q-mt-lg q-mb-md">Applications</h2>
        <p>
          The findings from our research inform policy recommendations for
          sustainable coastal development, waste management practices, and
          marine conservation initiatives. We work closely with local
          authorities, industries, and communities to develop practical
          solutions for reducing pollution inputs and mitigating environmental
          impacts. Our monitoring programs also contribute to early warning
          systems for environmental degradation.
